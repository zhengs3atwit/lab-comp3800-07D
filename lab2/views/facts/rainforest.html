        <h2>Fascinating Facts About Rainforest Animal Habitats</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Richest Biodiversity:</strong> Rainforests cover only around 6% of Earth's land area but are
                home to over half of the world’s plant and animal species.</li>
            <li><strong>Layered Ecosystem:</strong> Rainforests have distinct layers—emergent, canopy, understory, and
                forest floor—each supporting different types of animals adapted to those conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Rainfall Powerhouse:</strong> Tropical rainforests receive more than 80 inches of rain annually,
                which supports lush vegetation and diverse wildlife year-round.</li>
            <li><strong>Animal Specialization:</strong> Many rainforest animals are specially adapted for life in trees.
                Examples include monkeys with prehensile tails, birds with hooked beaks, and frogs with sticky pads.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Nighttime Activity:</strong> Many rainforest species are nocturnal, including insects, reptiles,
                and mammals that take advantage of cooler temperatures and darkness to avoid predators.</li>
            <li><strong>Camouflage and Color:</strong> To survive in the dense jungle, animals use camouflage to hide
                from predators, while some use bright colors to warn of toxicity or to attract mates.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital to the Planet:</strong> Rainforests are often called the "lungs of the Earth" because
                their dense vegetation produces a large amount of the planet's oxygen through photosynthesis.</li>
            <li><strong>Endangered Ecosystem:</strong> Rainforests are rapidly shrinking due to logging, agriculture,
                and development. This threatens not only biodiversity but also indigenous communities and the global
                climate.</li>
            <li><strong>Unexplored Species:</strong> Scientists believe millions of rainforest species remain
                undiscovered, especially insects, fungi, and small organisms critical to the ecosystem’s balance.</li>
        </ul>
