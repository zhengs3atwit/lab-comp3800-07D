        <h2>Fascinating Facts About Grassland Animal Habitats</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vast Ecosystems:</strong> Grasslands cover about one-quarter of the Earth's land and are found
                on every continent except Antarctica. They are dominated by grasses and herbaceous (non-woody) plants.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Types of Grasslands:</strong> There are two main types of grasslands: temperate grasslands (like
                prairies in North America and steppes in Eurasia) and tropical grasslands (like the savannas in Africa).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rich in Wildlife:</strong> Grasslands are home to iconic animals such as lions, elephants,
                zebras, bison, antelope, and prairie dogs. These animals have adapted to wide-open spaces and seasonal
                changes in rainfall.</li>
            <li><strong>Predator-Prey Balance:</strong> The flat terrain provides little cover, so many grassland
                animals rely on speed, camouflage, or herding behaviors to escape predators.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Adaptations:</strong> Grassland animals often migrate or hibernate depending on the
                season. Some burrow underground to escape extreme weather or predators.</li>
            <li><strong>Fire as a Natural Force:</strong> Periodic wildfires are natural in grasslands and help maintain
                the ecosystem by clearing old vegetation and encouraging new growth. Many grassland species are
                fire-adapted.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Richness:</strong> Grasslands have some of the most fertile soils in the world. This is why
                many have been converted into agricultural land, which poses a threat to the natural habitat.</li>
            <li><strong>Bird Life:</strong> Grasslands support a wide variety of bird species, from ground-nesting birds
                to raptors like hawks and eagles that patrol the skies.</li>
            <li><strong>Conservation Needs:</strong> Due to agriculture, overgrazing, and development, grasslands are
                among the most endangered ecosystems on Earth, with many species at risk of decline.</li>
