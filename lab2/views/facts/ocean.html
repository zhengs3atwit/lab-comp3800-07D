        <h2>Fascinating Facts About Ocean Animal Habitats</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Earth's Blue Planet:</strong> The ocean covers almost three-quarters of Earth's surface, earning
                our planet the nickname "Blue Planet." It's the largest biome on Earth, home to an incredible diversity
                of life.</li>
            <li><strong>Vast Zones:</strong> Ocean habitats range from shallow, sunlit waters near the coast to the
                deepest, darkest trenches. These can be broadly divided into coastal habitats (out to the continental
                shelf) and open ocean habitats (beyond the shelf).</li>
            <li><strong>Coastal Abundance:</strong> Even though coastal habitats only make up about 7% of the total
                ocean area, they support the majority of marine life. This includes vibrant ecosystems like coral reefs,
                kelp forests, seagrass meadows, estuaries, and mangrove forests.</li>
            <li><strong>Eco-Engineers:</strong> Many coastal habitats are actually built by the organisms living in
                them! Corals, kelp, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses are "eco-engineers" that reshape their
                environment, creating homes for countless other species.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Sea Mysteries:</strong> The deep ocean, far from the coast, is characterized by immense
                pressure, frigid temperatures, and complete darkness. Animals here have amazing adaptations, such as
                bioluminescence (producing their own light) and specialized bodies to withstand extreme pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Factors of Life:</strong> The conditions in an ocean habitat, such as the amount of sunlight,
                temperature, water pressure, nutrient availability, and salinity, all play a crucial role in determining
                what plant and animal species can survive and thrive there.</li>
            <li><strong>Ocean's Oxygen:</strong> Around half of the oxygen we breathe on Earth actually comes from our
                oceans, largely thanks to microscopic marine algae and phytoplankton.</li>
            <li><strong>Incredible Adaptations:</strong> Marine animals have evolved incredible adaptations to survive
                in their unique ocean habitats. Examples include streamlined bodies for fast swimming (like sharks),
                specialized kidneys for salt regulation, and blubber for insulation in cold waters (like whales). Some
                deep-diving mammals even allow their lungs to collapse under pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Diversity:</strong> While about 240,000 marine species are currently known, scientists
                believe millions more are still waiting to be discovered in the vast and mysterious ocean.</li>
        </ul>
